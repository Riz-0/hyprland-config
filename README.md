## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This is my personal config for Hyprland - a Wayland compositor/window manager for Linux~~
as well as other stuff to extend functionality and looks.

## ðŸ¤¨ Installation
Just git clone!

## ðŸ“‹ TO-DO
- Add eww widgets
- Redo rofi configuration
- Rice the notifications
- Maybe configure pywal

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress
- 22/12/2024: Probably done ricing for now, it's been 4 days and this minimal setup is good enough. I'll continue when I have more time.
